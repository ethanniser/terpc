- use managed runtime (look at how mp and effect work does)
- add tests
- docs
  - add examples with vite nextjs and tanstack router
  - show adding vite env variables
- update to latest versions

- add useSuspenseQuery

goals:

- easiest way to consume effects in react using react-query (which you probably
  already use and are familiar with)
- native react query error typing
  - option to throw or catch defects (and expose as cause)

when should you not use this / use rx instead?

- i dont know
